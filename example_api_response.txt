Comment by umo abasute: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mediabias">#MediaBias</a>: See The Mainstream Media just proved that they literally bat for @TheDemocrats party by firing @RonnaMcDaniel but no one should feel sorry 😞 for her because after all she did try to cozy up to Mainstream Media knowing that they don’t like her viewpoints.
Comment by umo abasute: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23biasmedia">#BiasMedia</a>: The Mainstream Media have been given their marching orders to stop 🛑 at anything to help @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe get re-elected. Look at what they’re doing already going after @RobertKennedyJr running mate and Smearing @realDonaldTrump as usual. Stop 🛑 picking sides

Question 🙋‍♂️ to all Voters 🗳️ What has @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe done to help improve y’all lives? Don’t waste y’all vote 🗳️ by voting to re-elect Sleepy 😴 Joe. He has ruined America 🇺🇸 and The American 🇺🇸 Dream.
Comment by umo abasute: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dividingthecountry">#DividingTheCountry</a>: @POTUS Sleepy 😴 Joe has done more damaged to divide this country. Sleepy 😴 Joe promised to unite this country but he has decided to divide us. Calling half of America 🇺🇸 fascist? Really!? Demonizing them for simply loving America 🇺🇸? Sleepy 😴 Joe is toxic

Comment by Peter Aga: We want to see honest leader she or he (who can guarantee the whole world on the track of good economical progress)
Comment by Loubna Ll: For everyone who wants to lift the injustice against Palestine, we must hold demonstrations demanding that a Muslim be nominated for the presidency of America, because Biden or Trump are the same thing. We pay taxes and they send them to Israel or Ukraine to kill people. We need this money more than them. Let us all take action and demand a Muslim candidate. Otherwise, nothing will change. If you really want justice to prevail and children to be protected, let us all take action

The Future of America 🇺🇸 and Next Generation are at stake and we the Independent Voters can be the difference maker.
Comment by Laura Ragazzi: I don&#39;t want Trump as President, but he will win if he has Biden as a competitor. President Biden and Kamala Harris did a terrible job. I don&#39;t understand the Democratic Party anymore and sadly they don&#39;t represent my values anymore. Scaring times
Comment by Butterfly D: ROE ROE ROE YOUR VOTE IN ROEVEMBER 2024!!!💙💙💙<br>NO LABEL AND ROBERT F KENNEDY, JR = SPLITTING OF THE DEMOCRAT VOTE SO TRUMP CAN WIN!!!<br>DEMOCRATS NEEDS TO SECURE THEIR ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES!!!<br>LETS GO AMERICA!!!💙💙💙
Comment by SumTingWong: This “democracy” farce has to stop. Voting for a President is meaningless. The Electoral College picks the President. The popular vote tells the members of the Electoral College who they should vote for in the next election, which, being 4 years later, is ridiculous.
Comment by hoffy1955: The American political scene has hit rock bottom.  We have two geriatric narcissists, neither of which is qualified to actually run this country but that&#39;s okay.  That&#39;s really not important because, since 1963, no occupant of the Oval Orifice has been calling the shots here in Gomorra by the sea.  The steady stream of ambitious narcissists that have come and gone from the Dirty Grey House (formerly known as the White House) got there through the approval and financial support of the Rothschild led International Banking Cabal.  The same people who had Kennedy assassinated for threatening to shut down the Federal Reserve.  Imagine yourself a young, up and coming politician at the state or even local level.  One day you are approached by a group who informs you that you have been selected to be &quot;fast-tracked&quot; to high political office in return for your......cooperation in the future.  You can literally have it all for the price of your soul, or your political ambitions will end.  They then break out the 8mm film of Kennedy being assassinated, not the Zapruder film but another one made by an individual standing next to the guy with the scoped rifle behind the fence.  The choice is obvious you can be honored, admired even idolized......or you can be Kennedy.  100 out of 100 candidates will take the money and the puppet strings that come with it.  This nation is not exhibiting the signs of a healthy vibrant society, quite the opposite.  Neither of the 2 old men vying for the Oval Orifice are good people because good people no longer have political ambitions. The American political arena is filled with the worst example of humanity to be found.  We are being led, at all levels, to slaughter by people who should be incarcerated for crimes against humanity.  That is why America is in the mess it is today and it is only going to get worse in the future.  The 2 party system was designed to keep us divided and powerless.  It isn&#39;t broken, it&#39;s working exactly as it was designed.  Kennedy was a leader, everyone since has been a political puppet of the wealthy ruling elite.

Comment by Thomas Aungst: Trump will have Biden mumbling in a corner while he talks in circles around him .
Comment by yeraldin marquez: Please read it until the end, it is very important that you know this : For the well-being of our country, I would recommend you vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr, because he knows very closely the reality of the crisis that health services face regarding the excessive medical care costs, along with the labor, business and industrial crisis. that our nation faces, recognizes the decline that has occurred in moral (civil) authority in recent decades and previous years, recognizes the freedom that investors and shareholders must have within the private sector, for which it has a political ideology innovative, which will lay the foundations for the resurgence of the fundamental values ​​on which the foundations of our nation originated and government stability and good management of resources will be guaranteed in a more viable way. I know that there are many corrupt politicians, but if you can see very closely and in detail when a politician is truly committed to helping the people, remember that we the citizens define our nation, we the people...

Comment by halfan ndaruke: I like this news❤
Comment by Tony Neal: From an outsiders perspective....Love the quirkiness of American politics. One quarterback is suffering from the middle stages of dementia and doesn&#39;t have a clue who he&#39;s going to pass the ball to. The opposing captain only wants the ball passed to him. In the land of the brave and free, you can send a guy off to war who can legally kill someone but when he returns home, (in some US states), he can&#39;t go down to the local bar and buy a beer. Love American politics!

Is he happy with North Korea&#39;s Mr. Kim, who wants to attack the Republic of Korea and threatens to bomb the U.S.?Does he still consider the president from China to be a great leader?does Mr. Trump think that the USA will be able to produce the latest technology itself and will be able to produce unique technical things, but also products for normal people?
